In this blog post, I take a look at some very simple feature engineering, and feature importances for simple machine learning models. I got my data from Kaggle, the larger set is from a set of 50,000 pokemon battle done by an algorithm. I'm missing some important human, and game elements, but it lends itself to demonstrating some concepts.
