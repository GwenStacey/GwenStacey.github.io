title: About me
---

My name is Charles Purcell:
- I am currently  learning to be a data scientist through Lambda Schools
- It's a big goal of mine to make my way into the Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence sectors



### my history

I've been doing my best to self learn the basics of coding for a few years now. Most of my experience is with Python, C#, and a tiny bit of javascript. Now that I'm in school with Lambda I'm focusing on Python, and data science, hopefully leading machine learning. I have a big passion for procedural content generation specifically.
